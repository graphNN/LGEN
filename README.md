# TLayer-Wise Graph Neural Network

## Requirements

python == 3.7.6

torch == 1.8.1

dgl == 0.5.2

## Results

We run 'DGL_train_citation' to get the results of we reproduced model on citation datasets and run 'DGL_train_citation'
to get the results of we reproduced model on WebKB datasets.

We run 'LGEN_train_citation' to get the results of LGEN on citation datasets and run 'LGEN_train_citation'
to get the results of LGEN on WebKB datasets.

We run 'LGEN_analysis' to get 'h'.
